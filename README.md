# Olympic-Medal-Analysis-A-Data-Driven-Insight-into-Global-Sporting-Success
Introduction
This project is focused on analyzing the distribution of Olympic medals across various event types and understanding the gender distribution among medalists. Using data visualizations, we aim to explore patterns and trends in the Olympic Games, which can provide valuable insights into the performance of athletes and countries over time.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

Data Loading and Preparation:

Files are uploaded and loaded into the environment for analysis.
The datasets include information about athletes, medals, events, and teams.
Data Cleaning:

Datasets are cleaned to remove any missing or irrelevant data.
This ensures the accuracy of the subsequent analysis and visualizations.
Gender Distribution Among Medalists:

A pie chart is used to visualize the gender distribution of Olympic medalists.
This chart provides insights into the representation of male and female athletes in the Olympics.
Medals by Event Type:

A bar plot is created to show the distribution of medals based on event type (e.g., individual vs. team events).
The visualization helps to understand which types of events have the highest number of medals.
Data Sources
The project uses the following datasets:

athletes.csv: Contains information about athletes, including their nationality and gender.
medals.csv: Includes details about the medals awarded, including the type of event and the gender of the medalist.
teams.csv: Provides data on the teams participating in the Olympics.
Visualizations
1. Gender Distribution Among Medalists
Description: This pie chart illustrates the proportion of male and female athletes who have won Olympic medals.
Objective: To analyze gender representation among the top-performing athletes in the Olympics.
2. Medals by Event Type
Description: This bar plot displays the number of medals awarded in different types of events, categorized as individual or team events.
Objective: To explore which types of events are most frequently rewarded with medals.
How to Run the Project
Upload the datasets:

Use the google.colab.files.upload() function to upload the required CSV files (e.g., medals.csv, athletes.csv, teams.csv).
Execute the Python Scripts:

Run the provided Python scripts to load the data, clean it, and generate the visualizations.
Visualizations will be displayed using Plotly, which provides interactive charts.
Understanding the Visualizations
Légende des Types d'Événements (Event Types Legend):
ATH: Athletics events, usually individual.
HATH: Likely a subset of athletics or half-marathon type events.
TEAM: Team-based events where groups compete together.
HTEAM: Possibly a subset or specialized team events.
HCOUP: Could represent decisive or knockout-type events.
COUP: Possibly related to critical points or decisive victories in events.
Note: The exact meanings of the event type abbreviations may vary. It’s recommended to refer to the metadata provided with the datasets for precise definitions.

Results
The project successfully visualizes key insights into the distribution of Olympic medals by gender and event type.
These visualizations can help identify trends in Olympic performance and provide a better understanding of how different types of events contribute to overall medal counts.
Conclusion
This analysis project provides valuable insights into the Olympic Games, helping to understand the distribution of medals among different types of events and genders. The interactive visualizations created using Plotly make it easy to explore the data and derive meaningful conclusions.
